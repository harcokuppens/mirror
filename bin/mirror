DESCRIPTION
  The mirror command synchronises contents of sourcedir into  destdir
  where either sourcedir or destdir may be a directory
  on a remote machine, a docker container, or on a docker image.
  Destination is updated to match source, including deleting 
  files if necessary.

  Because mirror does delete files if necessary it by default 
  gives a warning, and asks you to continue or not:
 
    We STRONGLY advice to do a 'dry-run' first (option -n), because 
    mirroring can destroy the destination if you are not careful!
    Are you sure you want to continue? <y/N> y

  Mirror wraps the rsync command to give it a simpler interface
  to ease mirroring operations. The name mirror describes
  better the functionality because rsync does mirroring,
  and cannot do bi-directional sync like many cloud storage
  solutions nowadays do.
  
  The diffdir command is just 'mirror --dry-run -i' to quickly find
  the difference between sourcedir into  destdir.

OPTIONS
   -a            to preserve all; meaning preserving also user,group,other and their permissions
                 Without this option the only attributes preserved are the modification times,
                 which often suffices for a single user computer
   --dry-run     dry runs the mirror. Which means it doesn't do any file transfers, 
                 instead it will just report the actions it would have taken.
   --file        mirror a file instead of a directory              
   -f PATTERN    
   --filter PATTERN
                 applies a filter on what to mirror; with '- path' you can exclude a path, 
                 and with '+ subpath' you can include a subpath from the excluded path again. 
                 Paths starting with '/' are seen as absolute root-based paths, and
                 without are seen as relative paths which are matched in each subdir. 
                 For more details see the man page of rsync. 
   -i            Itemize changes: output a change-summary for all updates on destination to let it mirror the source.
                 Each item's change-summary is represented with the format:

                     YXcstpog
                     
                 where
                     Y is updatetype letter:  
                         .(same) c(change/creation) <(transfer to sourcedir) > (transfer to destdir)
                     X is filetype letter:  
                         f(ile), d(irectory), an L for a symlink, a D for a device, and a S for a special file (e.g. named sockets and fifos).
                     cstpog are possible letters which specify what is different:
                         c(hecksum) s(size) t(ime modification) p(ermissions) o(wner) g(roup)
                         per letter L we have 3 cases: 
                           a) on change the letter 'L' is printed
                           b) no change then '.' is printed
                           c) on a new file or directory '+' is printed
                 for more info: see man page of rsync      
   --keep-dest-only      
                 do not delete files on destination which are not in source   
   --no-git      excludes .git folder from mirroring; same as:  -f '- .git
   --no-warn     do not warn about the risks, but directly do the mirror
   -t TRIGGER   
   --trigger TRIGGER   
                 The trigger option determines how it is determined whether a file must be
                 synced or not. We have the following triggers: 
                   - modsize: either modification or size change triggers sync (default)
                   - sizeonly: only size change triggers sync 
                   - checksum: difference in local and remote checksum triggers sync
                   - always: always triggers sync
                 Note: even when doing always a sync the rsync algorithm does a smart
                       delta sync, meaning it only needs to transfer the difference 
                       between a local and remote file to sync them.
   -u, --update  skip files that are newer on the destination         
   -v or -vv     This  option increases the amount of information you are given during the transfer.  By default, mirror works silently. 
                 A single -v will give you information about what files are being transferred and a brief summary at the end. 
                 Two -v options will give you information on what files are being skipped and slightly more information at the end.              
   --rsync-options RSYNC_OPTIONS  
                 add extra rsync options; see man page of rsync
   -d            Print mirror's debug messages.                 

NOTES
  DESTDIR and SRCDIR are taken relative from the default remote directory,
  unless they start with a '/' then they are taken as absolute paths from the
  root directory on the remote.
   
  Mirror is wrapper around rsync. In rsync you can specify a remote shell for
  either source or destination.  The remote shell is used to start rsync on the
  remote side with which the local rsync communicates to via stdin/stdout to do the sync. 
  So it is required that rsync is installed on the remote.
  For a remote host using ssh the remove shell is 'ssh'. For a remote docker 
  container the the remote shell is 'docker exec -i'.
  
  For a remote using docker:// we use a docker container as remote,
  so we use the containername instead of hostname to specify the remote location.
  
  For a remote using docker-img:// we use a docker image as remote, 
  but because we can only rsync into a running container a dummy container
  is created for the image. After mirroring on the container is done a 
  modified image is extracted from the container. (using 'docker commit')
